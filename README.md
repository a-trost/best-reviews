# The Best Reviews

Hey, remember the Foo Fighters' song from 2005, ["Best Of You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_L4Rixya64)?

Yeah, pretty good song, right?

Could you imagine making a joke based on the chorus, then creating an entire site just so you could make that same joke over and over?

No?

Well now you don't need to imagine. I've done it.

*The Best Reviews* is a site that gives you thousands of reviews from across America, all "written" by Dave Grohl*.

Want to know what Dave thinks about the places near you? He's been there** and he's written a short, glowing review about it***.

*Definitely, definitely NOT written by Dave Grohl. Not even a little. God I hope he never finds this. I'm sorry, Dave.

**Maybe.

***He most definitely hasn't.
